# PackItUp(load)
Utility to streamline uploading Packwiz-powered modpack versions to supported modpack providers (such as Modrinth)

**If you decide to use this software, please provide attribution to https://codeberg.org/Dexrn/PackItUp and/or https://packitup.dexrn.me in your modpack readme.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The codebase at this stage in development is **very** messy, as I just need to get things working, and then clean everything up before releasing v1.0.0.
>
> Docs will be made when 1.0.0 is released, and accessible at [this webpage](https://packitup.dexrn.me).
